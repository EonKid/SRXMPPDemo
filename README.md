A big thanks to Robbie for creating and maintaining this framework.

**SRXMPP DEMO **
A demo on XMPP in Objective C, with various simple and complex features implemented in it.
Few features this project contains are --


**SRXMPP** - A wrapper Singleton class that almost has all features needed for one-to-one chat application.
* one to one chat
* Core data implementation of chat thus having saving of previous messages, offline messages.
* implementation of vCard(profile information of user, own and others too) from XML and Core Data provided by Robbie Hanson's own framework.
* availability of friends status (online/offline,typing)

In short this example project along with the singleton has almost all features that are needed for a One-to-One chat application to have.
Share and help this example get better.
A big thanks to Robbie once again for the awesome framework. Cheers.
